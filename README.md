# 🤖 Free, Self-Hosted Claude AI Interface

A fully functional, polished, and self-hosted web interface for Anthropic's Claude AI. This project runs entirely in your browser, using the free tier of **Puter.js** for secure access to the Claude API. No backend, no server costs, 100% free.


### 🚀 Key Features

*   ✅ **100% Free Access:** Leverages the free tier of Puter.js to interact with the Claude API at no cost.
*   🎨 **Polished UI:** A clean, modern interface inspired by the official Claude UI, with light and dark mode support.
*   📄 **Artifact Generation:** Automatically renders code blocks into beautiful, interactive "artifact" canvases with syntax highlighting, copy, download, and even an HTML preview feature.
*   💬 **Streaming Responses:** Watch Claude's responses appear in real-time, just like the official experience.
*   📂 **Local Chat History:** Remembers your recent conversations in your browser's local storage.
*   🔐 **Secure Authentication:** Handles Puter.js authentication directly in the browser with a clear, user-friendly flow.

### ❓ How It Works

This interface does **not** use a pirated or reverse-engineered API. It uses the official, legitimate **Puter.js** library. When you first use the app, it will ask for a one-time authentication with your Puter account. This securely connects the web app to **your own account's** free Claude API access, ensuring everything is secure and above board.

### ▶️ Getting Started (How to Run)

https://obitech-claude-unlimited.vercel.app/

### ✅ Prerequisites

This project has minimal dependencies, making it very easy to set up. All you need is:

1.  **🐍 Python 3:**
    *   This is **only** required to run the simple local web server. The application itself is 100% JavaScript.
    *   **No `pip` packages are needed.** The `http.server` module is included with Python by default.
    *   Most macOS and Linux systems have Python pre-installed. For Windows, you can download it from [python.org](ht

2.  **🌐 A Modern Web Browser:**
    *   Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari.

That's it! There are no other libraries or frameworks to install.


4.  **Open Browser:** Open your web browser and go to the address `http://localhost:8000`.

**First Use:** The first time you send a message, a small popup will appear asking you to authenticate with Puter. Please **allow the popup** to enable the free AI access.



### 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
*   **API Integration:** Puter.js SDK (`@puter.com/v2`)
*   **Development:** No frameworks, just pure, efficient code.
